## About me

Hello I am a helper at New Time Development and I am not very good at programming. But I still think GitHub is a good and important platform ;D


## What do I use GitHub for?
- Stalking [Sage](https://sagesphinx63920.dev)
- Look at interesting projects out of boredom
- Thinking about what I could suggest to [Sage](https://sagesphinx63920.dev) as a nice idea for Eftron 24/7
